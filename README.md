# Gluco Sense – AI-Powered Diabetes Detection for Early Intervention

**Gluco Sense** is a machine learning-based project designed to detect the early onset of diabetes using health-related data. The system aims to assist in early intervention by identifying individuals at risk through data analysis and predictive modeling.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Early prediction of diabetes using ML algorithms
- Enhance preventive healthcare through AI
- Provide interpretable and scalable diagnostic tools

## 🧪 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, scaling, encoding
- Multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualizations for data understanding and model performance


## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

Uses the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset** or similar publicly available medical datasets. (Make sure you cite the source if it's from Kaggle or UCI.)

## 🔍 Results

The trained model achieved:
- Accuracy: `89%`
- Precision: `85%`
- Recall: `83%`
- F1-Score: `84 %`
